this repo is to try and improve/demonstrate my understanding of the changes that came in .Net 8. The inspiration comes from Nick Chapsas's .Net Developer roadmap.

General:
- Support for 3 years released November 14, 2023
- Performance improvements, Garbage collection and libraries etc
- Globalization mode for mobile apps ...
- Some SDK stuffs (Software Development Kit - bc I can never remember)

C# 12 - Go look at the C#12 folder for examples of stuff brought in with C# 12

.Net aspire - won't mention anything here. It is on the roadmap to learn

ASP.NET core improvements

.NET MAUI - I tried using .NET MAUI before and I personally will not be learning how to 
use it more because what I did do with it was rather painful for even simple ish stuff
Definitely not for now but maybe if it gets more love

EF Core various improvements

Multi Platform container images - I currently have no need for this but nice to know


".NET 8 adds support for OAuth token exchange
authentication (Azure Managed Identity) when pushing containers to registries. "

other stuff
