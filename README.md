this repo is to try and improve/demonstrate my understanding of the changes that came in .Net 8. The inspiration comes from Nick Chapsas's .Net Developer roadmap.

General:
- Support for 3 years released November 14, 2023
- Performance improvements, Garbage collection and libraries etc
- Globalization mode for mobile apps ...
- Some SDK stuffs (Software Development Kit - bc I can never remember)

C# 12 - Go look at the C#12 folder for examples of stuff brought in with C# 12
