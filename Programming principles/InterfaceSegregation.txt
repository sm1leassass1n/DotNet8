Clients like classes etc should not be forced to rely on/implement methods they do not use.

In cases where this happens the interface is not specific enough and should have their scope tightened

Example
Interface IVehicle
Method Drive
Method Fly

Class Car inherites IVehicle
Method Drive implemented
Method Fly Not implemented

Class Plane inherites IVehicle
Method Drive implemented
Method Fly implemented

you are breaking interface segregation rules for the car class
