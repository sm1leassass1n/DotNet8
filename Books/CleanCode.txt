overall thoughts: 
I love this book and want to revisit it. I havent read it in a couple years but the whole start of the book is the philosophy behind why you should write clean code.
It doesn't lecture you on why like most people naturally would because it's almost not the point and it just gives examples and stories from real people and 
their thoughts. 

I must admit that the only thought from the start of the book that has stuck with me is the idea that your code is your house. And that other developers
are coming to visit. If your house is in pristine condition they are likely to treat your house very nicely out of respect for you and your efforts.
But, if they visit and you have a smashed window and mess on the floor they aren't gonna care. They are likely going to want to do what they need and leave.

Writing clean code is effort and requires practice. You need to be a boy scout making things better than you found them. It is tireing work to clean code.
I do it as much as I can and will admit sometimes it gets too much and I rush when the code isnt mine to start. But anyone can write clean code. 
You just have to want to.
